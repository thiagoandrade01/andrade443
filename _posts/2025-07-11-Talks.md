# Talks

## Cyber Security

### Bypassing All or Almost All AVs/EDRs with Simple Techniques

- Summary: In this talk, we will explore how the combination of simple malware development and obfuscation techniques can effectively bypass the most widely used AVs (Antivirus) and EDRs (Endpoint Detection and Response). The presentation will demonstrate, in practice, that known bypass strategies, when efficiently combined, can achieve a success rate approaching 100%.
The motivation for this content stems from a successful Red Team campaign, in which we faced the challenge of dealing with unknown and unpredictable defenses. The goal is to provide valuable insights for offensive and defensive security professionals, helping them better understand vulnerabilities in current protection systems.

### Installing Debian on an encrypted disk using LUKS

- Summary: Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) is a disk encryption specification created by Clemens Fruhwirth in 2004 and originally intended for Linux. We will demonstrate how to install Debian with disk encryption using LUKS with LVM (Logical Volume Management). Disk encryption is essential today to protect your data in the event of a breach of your laptop or hard drive.
