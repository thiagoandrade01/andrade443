# 👋 Welcome to My Corner of the Net

Hey folks! I'm **Thiago Andrade** — a passionate cybersecurity professional, Debian Developer, and Red Teamer.

![Me](https://andrade.wiki.br/assets/img/personal/ta-300x266.jpeg)

## 🧠 About Me

With years of hands-on experience in **Penetration Testing**, **Red Teaming**, and **vulnerability analysis**, I’ve made a career out of breaking (and fixing) things. I specialize in simulating real-world cyber attacks to help organizations understand and improve their security posture.

I’m known for:
- 🔍 Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities with precision  
- 🤝 Leading security teams and collaborating across all organizational levels  
- 💬 Translating tech jargon into clear insights for stakeholders  

## 🛠️ Offensive Cyber Security Meets Debian

As an official member of the **Debian Project** 🐧, I merge my passion for offensive security with the elegance of free software. As a Debian Developer I maintain some packages like **ffuf, gobuster, dnsmap, proxychains-ng**. [**See the full list**](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=andrade@debian.org)

On this site, I’ll be sharing:
- ⚔️ Red Team techniques & tools  
- 📦 Debian tips  
- 🛡️ Security research & write-ups  
- 🎤 Slides and content from past **talks**

All content here is open and free to use — because knowledge should be shared, not hoarded. 💡
